Today, we will build a Password and Notes Manager in Java with Swing. This application can be helpful in storing and managing passwords and notes for an individual.

Features
Generate a random Password of a length >4
Store and Retrieve passwords
Delete a password
Encrypt a plain text with a secret key
Decrypt the encrypted text with the secret key
Add a note and view the note added

We have used an ArrayList to store the notes and a HashMap structure to store the name and password associated with the name. For encryption, we have used the PBEWithMD5AndDES algorithm.![Password-Manager](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74030143/222928594-35f451c9-c7e2-4265-a358-3b8b4d7b4e3e.jpg)
